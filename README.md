# Meme_Generator
The final project in Udacity's Intermediate Python Nanodegree program. 

In this project, we were tasked with creating a program that superimposes quotes over images to create randomized memes. The quotes were stored in four different file types. Our goal was to properly ingest the content of these files into blank models of our own design. quotes for this project were a combination of starter code, ideas that I brainstormed, and cherry-picked entries from the following link: [DogCaptions](https://getchip.com/dog-captions/#Short_Dog_Captions_for_Instagram). I replaced the starter image files with a collection of my own dog, Moose, who unfortunately lost his battle with Leukemia in 2016. This project serves as a loving memorial to showcase the comedic, snarky, and loving nature that Moose brought to the life of anyone who met him for over a decade. 

This project was a chance to showcase the skills presented to us in the **'Large Codebases with Libraries'** Course, including: 

- Object-Oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
- DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles of class and method design
- working with modules and packages in Python.
- Keeping code and docstrings PEP-8 compliant


## Overview
At the highest level of functionality, this project must complete the following requirements (taken directly from project instructions): 
- Interact with a variety of complex filetypes. This emulates the kind of data you'll encounter in a data engineering role. 
- Load quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Docs, CSVs, Text files). 
- Load, manipulate, and save images/ 
- Accept dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service. This emulates the kind of work you'll encounter as a full stack developer.


## Setup Instructions
I developed my code on a Windows laptop, running Python 3.9.8.
